# Football Analysis Project

## Introduction
Introducing our graduation project: "Football Match Analysis Using AI" âš½ðŸ¤–, a system designed to bring precision, automation, and insights into football analysis like never before!

## Our System Can: 
1. Detect and track players and the ball throughout the match using cutting-edge computer vision algorithms.
2. Map teams and identify players with pinpoint accuracy.
3. Spot events such as goals, fouls, and substitutions in real-time, providing an instant and detailed overview of match dynamics.
4. Generate key metrics like ball possession and pass completion, enabling a comprehensive analysis of team performance.
